Project name: gapminder parsing. 

Author: Ajeet Parmar

Project components: 

Hash table for data: 
- main.cpp (handles parsing and taking user inputs)
- country.h (main file to handle holding data for each country)
- hash.h (main file to hold the hash table and its operations)

parsing the data: 
- gapminder.txt (holds the data for the information. If this isn't present, main.cpp 
  will generate an error message.)
- parse.R (in case gapminder.txt is deleted or uninentionally modified, running this
program will generate a new file.)

Research conclusions: 
    Currently, none of these have been created. These will be added as .Rmd files and will 
    contain conclusions based on certain demographics to disprove the idea that "developing" countries
    are in higher states of poverty than more econoically developed countries. 

    Note: in my reports, I will not refer to countries by labels such as first-world and third-world 
    since these were merely labels indicating political alignment during the Cold War. Instead, I will
    refer to countries as MEDCs (More economically developed country), LEDCs (Less economically developed country), 
    and transitional (consisting of transitioning nations such as the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa)).
